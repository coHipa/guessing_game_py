# Guessing Game

switched to Python, maybe it is better to actually break my brain with programming logic and not on writing tests,
borrow checker, syntax etc.

Maybe I continue my work on the "original" Rust version.

## Working on
alway working on little changes as I learn something new. So everything can be moved or changed in future versions.

- more player dmg
  - ~~crit-system~~

## Future ideas
- Loot
  - inventory
- Save game

Please keep in mind I'm a complete programming beginner. I need a lot of time for this work.
But have fun with this one as well
